# ArtLens: Turn Every Frame into Fine Art  
A mobile AI application that transforms photos/videos into stunning fine art using real-time filters.  

## About  
ArtLens leverages cutting-edge AI (TensorFlow Lite, Stable Diffusion) and computer vision (MediaPipe, DeepLabV3) to deliver seamless artistic transformations—all optimized for mobile devices. This is our **final-year project** for the **Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering (BSSE)** degree, built by a team of 4 students.  

## Features  
- **Real-time style transfer** (live camera + captured media) at 20–30 FPS on mid-range devices.  
- **Diverse art library** with filters inspired by Van Gogh, Renaissance, and Baroque styles.  
- **Prompt-based background replacement** (text-to-image via Stable Diffusion API).  
- **Performance-optimized** for devices with 4GB RAM (quantization, GPU acceleration).
